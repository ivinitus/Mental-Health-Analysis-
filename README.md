## Project: Mental Health Analysis

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze mental health data to predict depression and understand its contributing factors.

### Data
- Includes demographic and behavioral data collected from surveys.
- Preprocessing steps to clean and transform the data.

### Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model Evaluation using SHAP values and other metrics

### Results
- Model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting depression.
- SHAP analysis revealed that age and income are significant factors.

### Conclusion and Future Work
- Further work includes refining models and exploring additional features.
- Potential integration with healthcare applications.
